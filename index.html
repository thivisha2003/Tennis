    <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
    <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. Tennis is an <em><strong>Olympic sport</strong></em> and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users.</p>

	<h2><u>History</u></h2>
	<p>Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand.It wasn't until the 16th century that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called "tennis", from the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. <em><strong>Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game</strong></em>, which is now known as real tennis. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England. Further, the patenting of the first lawn mower in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst, worldwide, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.</p>

	<div id="rackets">
	<h3><u>Rackets</u></h3>
	<p>Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
	<div class="list">
	<ul>
	  <li>The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform.</li>
	  <li>The frame of the hitting area may not be more than 29 inches (74 cm) in length and 12.5 inches (32 cm) in width.</li>
	  <li>The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets.</li>
	  <li>The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<p>The rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been 32 inches (81 cm) until 1997, when it was shortened to 29 inches (74 cm).</p>
	</div>
    <div id="balls">
	<h3><u>Balls</u></h3>
	<p>Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="miscellaneous">
	<h3><u>Miscellaneous</u></h3>
	<p>Advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have wide, flat soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.</p>
